- Navigate to the Satellite folder:

```bash
cd scripts/satellite
```
- Run the TinyML satellite optimization script::

```bash
python nano_satellite.py --input datasets/satellite/sample_input.json --config configs/satellite_config.yaml

```
---
#### üì° Airwave NanoML

- Navigate to the Wireless folder:

```bash
cd scripts/wireless

```

- Run the wireless network optimization script:

```bash
python nano_wireless.py --input datasets/wireless/sample_data.json --config configs/wireless_config.yaml

```
---
#### üîå Wired NanoML

- Navigate to the Wireline folder:
  
```bash
cd scripts/wireline
```
